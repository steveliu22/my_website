    <div style="font-size:1.5rem;"> A GUI based editor created for image manipulation built in Java
      using the standard Swing
      library with functionality to sharpen, blur, and
      apply filters such as grayscale and sepia to imported and procedurally generated images. These
      features are implemented using matrix algebra to transform pixels.
      The codebase applies common object-oriented design patterns such as model-view-controller,
      command, and decorator to maintain
      flexibility, scalability, and efficiency for potentially new features. Extensive amounts of
      javadocs, comments, and testing through JUnit are also written to ensure future understanding
      of the codebase. This project was built in collaboration with fellow Northeastern student,
      David Sharick.
